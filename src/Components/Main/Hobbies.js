                    <p>I have a group of incredible friends who I studied with since kindergarden. We frequently get together to share big meals or to celebrate our bithdays. These meetings are a breath of fresh air and help us to disconect from the routine. Many times I cook for them, what makes me feel very confortable and I really enjoy it.</p>
                    <p>One of my favourite passions is football, I've practiced it since I was a kid and I still do it every weekend in different amateur tournements. I often go to the Hurac√°n's stadium to watch football matches and cheer my team. In addition, I have been a member of the online football manager "Hattrick" for many years.</p>
                    <p>For sure, most people would share the taste for travelling. Regardless of the high costs involved, my girlfriend and I always try to visit as many places as possible. I strongly believe that Argentina is one of the richest countries respecting landscapes.</p>
