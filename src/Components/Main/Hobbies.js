                    <p>Fortunately, I am not a work machine, I combine studies, job, household chores with entertainement. And so then, I would like to show you some of my prefered activities...</p>
                    <p>I have a group of incredible friends who I studied with since kindergarden, we frequently get together to have big meals or for bithdays. It helps us a lot to disconnect from the routine. Many times I cook for them, it is something that makes me feel very confortable and I really enjoy it.</p>
                    <p>One of my favourite passions is football, I practised it since I was a kid and I still play it every weekend in different amateur tournements. My body can't resist like some years ago but I could'n imagine not doing it. I often go to the Hurac√°n's stadium to watch a football match and encourage my team.</p>
                    <p>As far as I am concerned, most people would share with me the taste for travelling. Although many times money is an impediment, my girlfriend and I, try to visit as many places as we can. I believed Argentina is one of the most rich country regarding landscapes.</p>
